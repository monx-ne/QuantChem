  abstract  = "The study of the electronic structure of materials is at a
               momentous stage, with the emergence of new computational methods
               and theoretical approaches. This volume provides an introduction
               to the field and describes its conceptual framework, the
               capabilities of present methods, limitations, and challenges for
               the future. Many properties of materials can now be determined
               directly from the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics,
               bringing new insights into critical problems in physics,
               chemistry, and materials science.",
